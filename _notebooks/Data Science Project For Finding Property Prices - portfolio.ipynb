    "> This Data Science project I made as a course project for SoftUni. I have used a DataFrame from Kaggle - it has many addresses in California, cleaned the data using multiple techniques and made plenty of visualizations on interactive maps so we can see what we are working with. We can narrow the number of houses using the address, number of amenities, price and many more.\n",
    "In addition to this I have used Machine Learning Supervised Learning Classification algorithm 'Linear Discriminant Analysis', K-Nearest Neighbors and Train Test Split to analyze the data even further.\n",
